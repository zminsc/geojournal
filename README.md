# geojournal

For our GeoJournal app, we used MVVM architecture to structure an app that allows users to take notes that can be documented and sorted via location. Users can also attach images and title their notes along with their descriptions.

The two course concepts implemented are location data and persistent data storage. 
* Location data is used to document where the user is creating the note and to generate the map view of entries.
* Persistent data storage is used to maintain a user's previous entries even if they exit the app.
